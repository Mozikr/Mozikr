## Hi there :wave:
### :space_invader: About me

<p> My name is Szymon Mozol, </p>
<p> I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from WSB Merito University in WrocÅ‚aw, with a specialization in Cloud Application Development. I am a Unity Developer with a strong programming background in C#, and additional experience in Java and C++. I specialize in building scalable game systems, implementing multiplayer with Photon PUN, and integrating online services such as PlayFab and Steamworks. I am proficient in Unity subsystems including the event system, UI, animation, lighting, particles, sound, and the new Input System, with experience in both 2D and 3D development, code optimization, and applying design patterns and clean architecture principles. Additionally, I have completed a six-month Unreal Engine 5 course led by a Senior Developer from CD Projekt Red, and I continue to expand my skills in this engine.  I also have professional experience as a Help Desk Specialist (1st and 2nd line), which gave me solid knowledge of computer hardware, operating systems, software testing, and networks.</p>
