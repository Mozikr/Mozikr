## Hi there :wave:
### :space_invader: About me

<p> My name is Szymon Mozol, </p>
<p> I am a bachelor's degree holder in Computer Science at WSB Merito University in Wroc≈Çaw with specialization in cloud application developer. I spend most of my time creating games in Unity Engine with emphasis on programming them. I am learning to program in C# but i also know Java and C++. I can write clean, optimal and efficient code. I know the Unity engine very well, I can use event system, animations, UI, particle system, lighting system, sound system, the new Input system, import assets and configure them, handle 2D/3D graphics and much more. In my free time I also learn Unreal Engine 5. Ever since my childhood, I have cultivated a deep fascination for video games. Creating, playing, immersing myself in discussions about them, and avidly watching gaming content are my primary passions.</p>
